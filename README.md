# MBI-MUST
MBI MUST Summer Internship Project

This is the code for my summer project at MBI, under Timothy Saunders Lab. I did stochastic modelling of morphogens, where images uploaded into the simulation determine boundaries, source and receptors, and the effective diffusion is modelled with the synthesis diffusion degradation model.
diffusion2D.ipynb models particles over 144,000 steps with set parameters. The particle density is plotted against time and the final particle image is saved as a .tiff file for processing.

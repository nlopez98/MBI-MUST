# MBI-MUST
MBI MUST Summer Internship Project

This is the code for my summer project at MBI, under Timothy Saunders Lab. I did stochastic modelling of morphogens, where images are uploaded into the simulation that determine boundaries, source and receptors, and the effective diffusion is modelled.
